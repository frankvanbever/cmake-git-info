# CMake git info demo application

This is a very small demo on how I solved the problem of getting git information
into my C application. This is partially based on a
[blog post](https://www.mattkeeter.com/blog/2018-01-06-versioning/) by Matthew
Keeter.

## Build instructions

``` bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Then just execute it from the build directory:

```
./src/demo
```
